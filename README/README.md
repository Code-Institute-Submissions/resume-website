## **Testing**

The website works fine with all browsers.

works proberly on the **icons** in the skills section and on the **back to the top button** in the footer.

**Contact form**.
You can fill the contact form but not send since I dont have the knowledge to make it safe.

When **[Deploying website](https://yassinrby.github.io/resume-website/)** I found out that the external PDF link did not work and also the profile picture did not show up. After changing the path of those files it worked.

-----------------


## **Version control**

I found out the importance of the CLI the hard way. After almost finishing the "first version" of website I did not check the website in other devices but desktop and found out that the page had great overflow issues. After trying to fix the problem for many hours I made the desicion to rewrite the code. 
You can find the "first version" **[Here.](https://github.com/Yassinrby/myresume)**
